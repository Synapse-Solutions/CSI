              At CSI, every student's everyday matters. We use state of the art
              digital architecture to monitor and document the social and
              emotional wellbeing, academic progress, interests and strengths of
              our students. We also use this to make sure that parents as well
              as teachers are aware of the challenges that students may be
              facing in their learning so that we can address them well before
              they become genuine academic issues.

              We believe that it takes a village to raise a child. As such, at
              CSI we have made sure that parents have a regular meeting with the
              principal that places the child at the center. We use real life
              data gathered in real time at CSI to anchor our discussions to
              make sure that these meetings are substantive and deal with the
              core issues facing our students in their learning journey.

              Nutrition is a critically important and often under discussed part
              of a child's education. CSI has a purpose-built in-house kitchen
              which adheres to the highest standards of hygiene which provides
              its students with freshly cooked hot meals to meet their
              nutritional needs.
